//what do we want the user to see when the page loads

//nav bar
//search bar
//6 card components from the db
//footer

//create functional home component
//use the useQuery hook from apollo client library and import the query from utils/query.ts. this should match the backend because the backend is working

//create state variable: const {resources, setResources} = useState[]

//once data is in the useState variable then it will kickoff the JSX to map through and create a card for each object from the query

//useEffect for after the render of the initial component to call the callback function to run query

//have UL created to see each item to display on the screen. At that point we can work on styling the cards

//generate 6 cool resources with good links in the documents to render to the page
